Hi Marius,

How have you been? Thanks for the message, and congratulations on the move to Yale!

I'm flattered that you brought me up with Victoria for the pre-doc position. I recognize that this would be a great opportunity.

To offer full disclosure, I've been recovering from depression and burnout the last few months. But I have just started looking for work again and planning my next steps. I'm still considering applying for a PhD, but as you can imagine I've been struggling with the decision a bit.

Still, I am very interested in the position. If it's okay, would you have time for a brief chat about this? I'm in Vancouver time right now, and my schedule is open for this coming week.

Thanks,
Jack

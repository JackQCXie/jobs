OECD
Aggressive Tax Planning and Digitalization Unit

Dear Madam or Sir,

I am delighted to make your acquiantance through this letter. I am a public economist and former tax accountant with background in academic research and the private sector. I am seeking this junior analyst position to expand on my experience working with and researching tax issues, specifically in the public policy sector.

My previous position was a pre-doctoral research assistant in the Department of Economics at Stockholm University. Through my apprenticeship with Professor David Seim, I had the privilege to work with many highly accomplished public economists, including Professors Gabriel Zucman and Emmanuel Saez, *who in parallel to their academic work are also strong advocates of global minimum tax*

I worked with Gabriel Zucman, David Seim, and Marius Ring to analyze tax regressivity in Sweden and Norway. I worked with Emmanuel Saez and David Seim to analyze the effect of a 2002 Swedish reform requiring pre-population of taxable net wealth on individual tax returns. Details of these and my other project involvements are available in my resume.

My duties in this role required a wide variety of skills. They range from technical analysis and visualisation of data, to writing and researching summaries of Swedish legistlative histories on specific policies, to other investigations interviews
